# apollo-sort

## Purpose

In order to maintain consistency in a fundamentally unordered list of tasks, as a project manager, I want a Chrome extension to provide a button to sort a task list alphabetically.

## Usage

1. Download [js/apollo-sort.user.js](https://github.com/kibiz0r/apollo-sort/raw/master/js/apollo-sort.user.js)
1. Open the script with a text editor
1. Replace `<YOUR API KEY GOES HERE>` with your API key (e.g. `api_key = 'ABCDEFG1234...';`)
1. Open the script with Chrome
1. Approve the installation

Whenever you hit a URL matching `*.apollohq.com`, the script will watch for task lists and add a `Sort A-Z` button to its row of buttons.

## Advanced

### Using multiple Apollo workspaces

To use a different API key per Apollo workspace, you will need a copy of the script for each workspace and you will also need to make the UserScript header more specific.

Given two workspaces `thoughtsphere.apollohq.com` and `brainlounge.apollohq.com`:

1. Copy `apollo-sort.user.js` to `thoughtsphere-sort.user.js` and `brainlounge-sort.user.js`
1. Change the UserScript headers of both files to replace `*` with the workspace, either `thoughtsphere` or `brainlounge`
1. Set API key for each file (see Usage)

`thoughtsphere-sort.user.js`:
    // Generated by CoffeeScript 1.3.3
    // ==UserScript==
    // @match http://thoughtsphere.apollohq.com/
    // @match https://thoughtsphere.apollohq.com/
    // ==/UserScript==;
    ...code...
      api_key = 'ABCDEFG1234...';
    ...code...

`brainlounge-sort.user.js`:
    // Generated by CoffeeScript 1.3.3
    // ==UserScript==
    // @match http://brainlounge.apollohq.com/
    // @match https://brainlounge.apollohq.com/
    // ==/UserScript==;
    ...code...
      api_key = 'ZYXWVUT9876...';
    ...code...

## Troubleshooting

[Check the JavaScript console](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/console), you should at least see some output saying the script has been initialized. Other than that, check out any error output and responses from the server.

## Development

First of all, put your API key in a file named `my_api_key`. This will be used when compiling the script.

To start automatically compiling the JS whenever changes are detected, run `guard`.

To start Chrome and have it load the user script for manual testing:

* Run `rake`
* Click the script when Chrome "downloads" it
* Approve the installation
* Refresh the task list
